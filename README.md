# db_connect
Node-based connector to db and publish query results. Latest version is for electron build and localDB in MS SQLServer 2010.

Currently very much a work-in-progress. Known issues include:

1. Getting the header of the table to align properly and still float over with the buttons
2. Get it working on any other machine than mine
